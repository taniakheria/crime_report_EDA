# US Crime Trends: Exploratory Data Analysis

This project aims to uncover patterns and insights into US crime trends through exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python and data visualization libraries. The analysis is based on a dataset containing crime data from 2020 to the present.

## Overview

The project explores various aspects of crime data, including:

- Weekly trends in crime incidents
- Monthly patterns in crime occurrences
- Yearly analysis of crime trends
- Comparison of reported date and occurrence date
- Spatial distribution of crime incidents across different areas
- Geographical patterns of crime occurrence locations
- Analysis of crime rates by gender
- Identification of common weapons used in assaults
- Understanding the age profile of victims
- Segmentation of crime rates by victim race
- Overview of crime incidents by investigation status

## Requirements

To run the analysis code, you'll need the following Python libraries:

- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install these libraries using pip:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn


## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:git clone https://github.com/yourusername/US-Crime-Trends-EDA.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:cd US-Crime-Trends-EDA
3. 3. Run the Jupyter Notebook `crime_EDA.ipynb`:jupyter notebook crime_EDA.ipynb

4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute the code cells and visualize the results.

## Data

The dataset used for this analysis is `Crime_Data_from_2020_to_Present.csv`. It contains the following columns:

- DR_NO: Report number for the crime incident
- Date Rptd: Date the crime was reported
- DATE OCC: Date the crime occurred
- TIME OCC: Time the crime occurred
- AREA: Area code where the crime occurred
- AREA NAME: Name of the area where the crime occurred
- Rpt Dist No: Reporting district number
- ... (and more)
